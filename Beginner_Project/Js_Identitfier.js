// Identifiers are the JavaScript Names
// Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
//The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
// The Identifier / javascript name must begin with - A letter, dollar Signs , underscores


// Note :=>
// 1) Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.
// 2) This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers


// JavaScript is Case-Sensitive 
// The JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.

JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
